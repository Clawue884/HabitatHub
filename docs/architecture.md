# HabitatHub Architecture

HabitatHub is a modular, autonomous space habitat designed for sustainable living in space. The architecture is divided into several layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the habitat's functionality.

## Layers

### 1. Habitat Modules

* Life Support System (LSS)
* Energy Generation System (EGS)
* Food Production System (FPS)
* Robotics and Automation System (RAS)

### 2. Autonomous Systems

* Decision-Making System (DMS)
* Navigation System (NS)
* Control System (CS)

### 3. Data Management

* Database Management System (DBMS)
* Data Visualization System (DVS)
* Data Analysis System (DAS)

### 4. Tools and Interfaces

* Habitat Designer Tool (HDT)
* Habitat Simulator Tool (HST)
* Habitat Analyzer Tool (HAT)

### 5. Deployment and Maintenance

* Habitat Deployment Script (HDS)
* Habitat Monitoring Script (HMS)
* Habitat Maintenance Script (HMS)

## Communication Flow

The communication flow between the layers is as follows:

* Habitat Modules → Autonomous Systems → Data Management → Tools and Interfaces
* Autonomous Systems → Habitat Modules
* Data Management → Autonomous Systems
* Tools and Interfaces → Data Management

## Technology Stack

* Python 3.x for the majority of the codebase
* C++ for performance-critical components
* MySQL for database management
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
* Pandas and NumPy for data analysis

This architecture provides a modular and scalable design for the HabitatHub system, allowing for easy integration of new components and technologies as needed.
